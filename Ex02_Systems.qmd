## Exercise 1

Consider the following discrete signal $x[n]$:
$$x[n] =
\begin{cases}
1 + \frac{n}{3}, &-3 \leq n \leq -1\\
1, &0 \leq n \leq 3\\
0, &\text{elsewhere}
\end{cases}
$$

- a. Find the values of $x[n]$ and represent the signal graphically
- b. Represent graphically the signal $x[-n + 4]$
- c. Write the expression of $x[n]$ based on the signal $\delta[n]$
- d. Write the expression of $x[n]$ based on the signal $u[n]$

### Solution {.unnumbered}

a). *Find the values of $x[n]$ and represent the signal graphically*

Giving values for $n$ in the range $-3 \leq n \leq 3$, we obtain the following values for $x[n]$:
$$x[n] = \{..., 0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \underuparrow{1}, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...\}$$
The graphical representation of the signal is:

b). *Represent graphically the signal $x[-n + 4]$*

Let's give a name to the signal $x[-n + 4]$, say $a[n]$. We have:
$$a[n] = x[-n + 4]$$

To understand visually what this means, let's compute a few values of $a[n]$:
$$\begin{aligned}
a[0]=x[-0+4] &= x[4] = 0 \\
a[1]=x[-1+4] &= x[3] = 1 \\
a[2]=x[-2+4] &= x[2] = 1 \\
\end{aligned}$$

We have $x[4]$ moving to $a[0]$, $x[3]$ moving to $a[1]$, $x[2]$ moving to $a[2]$, which means that the signal $x[n]$ is reversed and then shifted.

We can continue and extend the signal $a[n]$ to the left and to the right, obtaining the full signal $a[n]$:
$$a[n] = \{..., \underuparrow{0}, 1, 1, 1, 1, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0, ...\}$$
